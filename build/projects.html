Wrote code to place requests in ILLiad, the library interlibrary loan system, on behalf of the user so that articles not in the library’s collection can be requested with one-click.  Developed export routine and indexing process to allow library print holdings to be available via OpenURL.</p>

<h3>VuFind and Summon</h3>

<p>Customized and implemented the open-source <a href="http://library.brown.edu/">library search</a> front-end VuFind.  Developed code to index multiple sets of local content - digital collections, research guides, student dissertations - and integrated that content with standard library catalog data.  Developed record drivers to allow for custom display of various content types.  Developed export scripts for ILS and local repository systems to keep index up-to-date.  Customized the <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Apache Solr</a> schema to meet the library’s needs.  The project won a university-wide staff innovation award.</p>

<h3>The Minassian Collection of Qur’anic Manuscripts</h3>

<p>Ingested metadata and raw images for ancient Qur’anic manuscripts into the Brown Digital Repository.  Wrote scripts to create derivative images for access copies.  Worked with curator and metadata specialists to index MODS metadata in Apache Solr for <a href="http://library.brown.edu/cds/projects/quran">public search and browsing</a> via a Django web application.  Implemented a sitemap to maximize the collection’s presence in search engines.</p>

<h3>Library accessions and cataloging statistical reporting database</h3>

<p>Worked with library departmental managers to develop a staff database to track accessions and cataloging activity in the library collections.  Coded custom logic for parsing MARC records and tabulating various statistical counts.  Developed ILS export routines to update the statistical database daily.

<h3>Book locator</h3>

<p>Rewrote an existing application that provides users with a <a href="http://library.brown.edu/find/Record/b5863423">specific floor and aisle location</a> for a given item in the library.  Included a web service that supports client-side integration so that the service can be easily integrated into <a href="http://library.brown.edu/easyarticle/borrow/get/BRj/">other sites</a>.  This system includes an administrative interface that allows library staff to maintain the database of call number locations.  This project was presented at the Innovative Interfaces Users Group meeting and shared the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bul/book-locator/overview">code</a> publicly.</p>

<h3>New Titles at the library</h3>

Installed development and live versions of CMS (Mediawiki).</p>

<h3>Hathi Trust and Open Library</h3>

<p>Using APIs provided by the Hathi Trust and the Open Library, inserts
links to full text public domain titles in <a href="http://pegasus.law.columbia.edu/record=b428691">bibliographic records</a>.  Relies completely on the APIs.  Requires no changes to the existing <a href="http://pegasus.law.columbia.edu/record=b309402">bibliographic record</a>.  Holdings are identified using the OCLC number.  A real time query is sent to the APIs as the page loads.  If the item isn't in the public domain, no link is displayed.</p>

<h3>Offsite request form</h3>

<p>Implemented a simplified and less error-prone <a href="http://pegasus.law.columbia.edu/record=b609702">request process</a> for titles located in the library's offsite storage facility.  A request link is inserted next to the item barcode and patrons simply provide contact information.  Javascript transfers the necessary metadata from the record screen to the record request form.  Uses the <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> Javascript library.</p>

<h3>Text a call number</h3>

<p>A Python-based web utility that allows patrons to <a href="http://pegasus.law.columbia.edu/record=b480398">text a call number and location</a> to mobile phones.

<h3>New books list</h3>

<p>Developed a more automated routine to display monthly lists of <a href="http://library.law.columbia.edu/newbooks/april2010.html">new acquisitions</a>.
Allows users to focuses on titles in particular subject areas or jurisdictions.
Uses information exported from the ILS to determine which titles should appear on the list and assigns a jurisdiction based on call number.  Also uses <a href="http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit/">Exhibit</a> for the presentation.</p>

<h3>Electronic bookplates</h3>

<p>An <a href="http://pegasus.law.columbia.edu/record=b730730">electronic form</a> of a traditional bookplate recognizing donated materials.  The tool inserts the plate as the page loads using a local note in the bibliographic record.  Also uses <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.</p>

<h3>Staff Wiki</h3>

<p>Installed and manage a staff wiki for storing documentation, library procedures and guidelines.  Serves as the library's intranet.  Uses open-source Mediawiki platform.  Integrated with institutional LDAP service for ease of use.  Implemented automated backup routines and developed custom skin/theme.</p>

<h3>Batch record retrieval and automated workflow</h3>

<p>Developed an ordering and processing routine that allows the library to automatically download bibliographic records, or 'copy cataloging'.  Uses a customized Z39.50 client written in Python.  Records are selected based
on library defined rules for record retrieval.</p>

<h1 class="title">Datasette hosting costs</h3>
  <date>1-16-21</date>
  <div id="post-contents">
    <p>I've been hosting a <a href="https://datasette.io/">Datasette</a> (<a href="https://baseballdb.lawlesst.net">https://baseballdb.lawlesst.net</a>, aka baseballdb) of historical baseball data for a few years and the last year or so it has been hosted on Google Cloud Run. I thought I would share my hosting costs for 2020 as a point of reference for others who might be interested in running a Datasette but aren't sure how much it may cost.</p>

<p>The total hosting cost on Google Cloud Run for 2020 for the baseballdb was $51.31, or a monthly average of about $4.28 USD. The monthly bill did vary a fair amount from as high as $13 in May to as low as $2 in March. Since I did no deployments during this time or updates to the site, I assume the variation in costs is related to the amount queries the Datasette was serving. I don't have a good sense of how many total queries per month this instance is serving since I'm not using Google Analytics or similar.</p>

<p>Google does report that it is subtracting $49.28 in credits for the year but I don't expect those credits/promotions to expire anytime soon since my projected costs for 2021 is $59.</p>

<p>This cost information is somewhat incomplete without knowing the number of queries served per month but it is a benchmark. The site is freely available and there's no attempt to limit its usage. In short, it costs about as much as a nice latte to run each month. For me, that's a low enough cost to keep it around for the few times a year I care to use it and for any utility others may be getting from it.</p>

<p>Thanks again to <a href="https://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a>  for building and maintaining Datasette and to the <a href="http://chadwick-bureau.com/">Chadwick Bureau</a> for maintaining, and making freely available, the Baseball Databank.</p>

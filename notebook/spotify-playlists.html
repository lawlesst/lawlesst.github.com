<h1 class="title">Creating Spotify Playlists via the Spotify API</h3>

  <div id="post-contents">
    <p>I've recently pushed <a href="https://github.com/lawlesst/spotify-playlists">code</a> to Github for a little hobby project I've been working. There are public radio music shows that I enjoy but am often not able to listen to because they are aired at a time that I'm busy. It's more convenient to listen on demand. I also spend most of my listening time in the Spotify app so I would rather listen there even if the show offers a feed from their site, and many don't. </p>

<p>While exploring the possibility of creating Spotify playlists of these shows, I learned that many of them publish their playlists on their show sites using an undocumented API provided by National Public Radio. I was able to use my browser to determine what HTTP calls I need to make to get the latest episodes and the tracks played. I was then able (after a rather steep learning curve) use the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api">Spotify API</a> to create playlists for the shows I'm interested in. </p>

<p>Now I'm able to run a script that will harvest the playlists for shows I'm interested in and update Spotify playlists that I can listen to at my convenience. I miss the DJ's introduction to songs and any local flavor of the show but it allows me to hear the music on demand. As I listen, the tracks become part of my Spotify listening history that can be mined by Spotify to offer me additional recommendations. </p>

<p>Since there were a few technical hurdles, mostly around authentication, with the Spotify API, I posted my <a href="https://github.com/lawlesst/spotify-playlists">code</a> for others to review. I may post more in-depth about this later. The <a href="https://github.com/lawlesst/spotify-playlists">project README</a> also includes more details on how to get started with the Spotify API.</p>

<p>Here are some of the shows I'm harvesting and their corresponding public Spotify playlist that I've created. You should still donate to your favorite public radio station. </p>

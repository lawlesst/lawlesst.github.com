    <p>I've published some <a href="https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-sample-data">code</a> for mapping CSV data to RDF using Python and JSON-LD on <a href="https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-sample-data">Github</a>.  The motivation for this work was:</p>

<ol>
<li>to provide sample data to help people get started with <a href="http://www.vivoweb.org/">VIVO</a>, the research profile system built on Semantic Web standards</li>
<li>to learn more about <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/">JSON-LD</a> and explore it as a tool for assisting with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">Extract Transform Load (ETL)</a> type work that's required for projects like VIVO.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most people wanting to convert data to RDF will have access to relational data sources or tabular data exported as CSV or TSV files.  Using Python to read in a CSV source, convert it to a list of dictionaries using the standard library's <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html">CSV module</a> and then map it RDF using a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD context</a> can be really straightforward.  See the <a href="https://github.com/lawlesst/vivo-sample-data/blob/master/positions.py#L20">context and code</a> for creating academic appointments in VIVO as example.</p>

<p>In a more real-world example, I've used a different <a href="https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/vivo-data-management/blob/master/vdm/context.py#L18">JSON-LD context</a> to convert JSON data from Pubmed and CrossRef APIs to a local publication ontology.  Here, too, JSON-LD provides a nice way to map from multiple, slightly different sources, to a common RDF model.</p>

<p>There seems to be potential for a community working with RDF in a common ontology, like VIVO, to collaborate on developing common contexts for various data types and sharing and reusing them.  Members could use these contexts in a variety of tools and not be tied to a particular implementation (like Python) since the JSON can be read by nearly all programming languages.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/RDFLib/">RDFLib</a> <a href="(https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib-jsonld)">plugin</a> for JSON-LD parsing and serializing is still undergoing development and the spec only became final in January of this year, so these are early days.  But I look forward to learning more about the spec and implementing it in other tools.</p>
